# restart

    Usage: docker-machine restart [arg...]

    Restart a machine

    Description:
       Argument(s) are one or more machine names.
       
Restart a machine. Oftentimes this is equivalent to
`docker-machine stop; docker-machine start`. But some cloud drivers try to implement a clever restart which keeps the same
ip address.

    $ docker-machine restart dev
    Waiting for VM to start...
